Pizzeria is a full-stack food ordering web application built to deliver a smooth and intuitive experience for both customers and pizza store owners. Whether you're hungry for a cheesy slice or managing a local pizzeria, this system has you covered.

Designed with a modern interface and powered by Flask and MongoDB, the platform enables real-time ordering, secure authentication, and seamless management of menus, orders, and user profiles. Customers can explore pizza categories, build their cart, and place orders — all from an elegant dashboard inspired by popular food delivery services. Meanwhile, store owners get a powerful backend to manage their inventory, view customer orders, and maintain their store profile with ease.

Perfect for educational use, startups, or anyone looking to build a robust food delivery system, this project combines clean code architecture, responsive design, and functional simplicity into one delicious package.
